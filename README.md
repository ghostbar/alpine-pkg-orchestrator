alpine-pkg-orchestrator
=======================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

This tool is used for building a package in several versions of alpine at the
same time using [`alpine-build-pkg`][alpine-build-pkg] and
[`docker-alpine-devel`][docker-alpine-devel].

Examples of this are [`alpine-pkg-nodejs`][alpine-pkg-nodejs] and
[`alpine-pkg-nodejs-lts`][alpine-pkg-nodejs-lts]

HOW DO I USE IT?
----------------
First, put it somewhere in your `$PATH` (I put it on `~/bin/`) and run it like
this:

    alpine-pkg-orchestrator -t v3.2 -p libuv

It expects a directory with the alpine version to build for (`edge` does not
need the `v` as a prefix) and inside, a directory with the package name that
will have an `APKBUILD`. In this case it would look like:

    ./v3.2
    ./v3.2/libuv
    ./v3.2/libuv/APKBUILD

And will leave the resulting packages in `./v3.2/pkgs` but the output is
configurable, doing:

    alpine-pkg-orchestrator -t v3.2:/tmp -p libuv

That way, instead of using `./v3.2/pkgs` it will use `/tmp`. But if you were to
build just one version at the time you could use
[`alpine-build-pkg`][alpine-build-pkg], so the magic isn't there, is in this:

    alpine-pkg-orchestrator -t v3.2 -t v3.3 -t edge -p libuv

And that will build all those versions and will leave the resulting packages
inside each version's `/pkgs` like:

    ./v3.2
    ./v3.2/pkgs
    ./v3.3
    ./v3.3/pkgs
    ./edge
    ./edge/pkgs
